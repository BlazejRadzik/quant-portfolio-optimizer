🏦 Quant Portfolio OptimizerAn interactive analytical tool for constructing and evaluating investment portfolios based on Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory and extreme risk metrics.👉 Live Application Link🛠 Core ModulesAsset Selection: Dynamic fetching of S&P 500 components, GPW (Warsaw Stock Exchange) stocks, and ETFs via the Yahoo Finance API.Optimization Engine: Implementation of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) utilizing the PyPortfolioOpt library to solve quadratic optimization problems.Risk Analytics: A dedicated module calculating historical Value at Risk (VaR) at a 95% confidence level.Backtesting: Historical performance simulation featuring an interactive timeline with annual year segregation.📈 MethodologyThe application is built upon three analytical pillars:1. Portfolio OptimizationThe model determines optimal asset weights ($\omega$) for three distinct scenarios:Max Sharpe Ratio: Maximizing excess return per unit of risk.Minimum Volatility: Minimizing the overall portfolio variance.Target Return: Optimizing for a specific investor-defined profit goal.$$SR = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}$$2. Value at Risk (VaR)Quantification of downside risk using the historical VaR (95%) model. This metric identifies the maximum expected daily loss that should not be exceeded with 95% probability.3.
